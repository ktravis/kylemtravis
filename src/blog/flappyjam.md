I've just submitted my entry to [itch.io](http://itch.io)'s [FLAPPYJAM](http://itch.io/jam/flappyjam)! See it/[play it here](http://kmakai.itch.io/flee-lethal-avian-pests).

The game was made in Haxe over a period of two weeks using HaxeFlixel, with [BFXR](http://bfxr.net) for sound effects, and [Bosca Ceoil](http://distractionware.com/blog/2013/08/bosca-ceoil/) for the music.

I'll be writing up a longer-form post-mortem tomorrow morning, but that being said I'm quite satisfied with this as my first finished game jam entry. Two weeks went by fast!
